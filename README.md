- **Multi-Tier Reports**: Different levels of analysis depth (teaser, tier2, tier3)
- **Secure File Storage**: Protected pitch deck storage with role-based access
- **User Role Management**: Distinct interfaces for startups, VCs, and admins
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized experience across all devices

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT API
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe
